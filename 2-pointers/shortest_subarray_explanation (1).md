## The Complete Solution Code

```python
class Solution:
    def findLengthOfShortestSubarray(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        
        # Step 1: find longest non-decreasing prefix
        left = 0
        while left + 1 < n and arr[left] <= arr[left + 1]:
            left += 1
        if left == n - 1:
            return 0  # array is fully sorted

        # Step 2: find longest non-decreasing suffix
        right = n - 1
        while right > 0 and arr[right - 1] <= arr[right]:
            right -= 1

        # Step 3: possible answer = removing either left or right side
        ans = min(n - left - 1, right)

        # Step 4: try merging prefix and suffix
        i = 0
        j = right
        while i <= left and j < n:
            if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
                ans = min(ans, j - i - 1)
                i += 1
            else:
                j += 1

        return ans
```

## The Problem Statement
Given an array, we want to remove the shortest possible subarray so that the remaining elements form a non-decreasing sequence. This is a classic problem that tests your understanding of two-pointer techniques and array manipulation strategies.

## Core Insight and Strategy
The key insight is that after removal, the remaining sequence must be non-decreasing. This remaining sequence can only take three possible forms: either just a prefix (left part) of the original array, just a suffix (right part), or a combination where we keep some elements from the beginning and some from the end.

Think of this like organizing a bookshelf where most books are already in order on the left side and right side, but there's chaos in the middle. We want to remove the minimum number of books to make the entire shelf ordered. We could keep just the left organized section, just the right organized section, or cleverly combine parts of both sections if they work together.

## Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis

Let's trace through the algorithm with the example array: `[1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]`

### Step 1: Find Longest Non-Decreasing Prefix

```python
# Starting from the beginning, find how far we can go while maintaining order
left = 0
while left + 1 < n and arr[left] <= arr[left + 1]:
    left += 1
```

```
[1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]
 ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑
 0  1  2  3
```

We scan from left until we find a decreasing pair. Here, we have `1 ≤ 2 ≤ 3 ≤ 10`, but then `10 > 4`, so our prefix ends at index 3. The variable `left = 3` represents the last index of our valid prefix. Our prefix is `[1, 2, 3, 10]`, which contains 4 elements and is perfectly sorted.

The algorithm checks `arr[left] <= arr[left + 1]` to ensure we're maintaining non-decreasing order. When this condition fails, we've found the boundary of our longest sorted prefix.

### Step 2: Find Longest Non-Decreasing Suffix

```python
# Starting from the end, find how far we can go while maintaining order
right = n - 1
while right > 0 and arr[right - 1] <= arr[right]:
    right -= 1
```

```
[1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]
              ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑
              4  5  6  7
```

We scan from right to left until we find a decreasing pair. Here, we have `2 ≤ 3 ≤ 5`, so our suffix starts at index 5. The variable `right = 5` represents the first index of our valid suffix. Our suffix is `[2, 3, 5]`, which contains 3 elements and is perfectly sorted.

The algorithm checks `arr[right - 1] <= arr[right]` to ensure we're maintaining non-decreasing order as we move leftward. When this condition fails, we've found the boundary of our longest sorted suffix.

### Step 3: Consider Removing Entire Left or Right Side

```python
# Calculate cost of keeping only prefix or only suffix
ans = min(n - left - 1, right)
```

This step explores two straightforward strategies: keeping only the good prefix or keeping only the good suffix.

#### Strategy 1: Keep Only the Prefix
```
Original: [1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]
           ←---prefix---→  ←-remove this part-→
           [1, 2, 3, 10]   [4, 2, 3, 5]

Result: [1, 2, 3, 10] ✓ (already sorted)
```

When we keep only the prefix, we preserve elements from index 0 to `left` (indices 0, 1, 2, 3) and remove everything from index `left + 1` to the end (indices 4, 5, 6, 7). The number of elements to remove is `n - (left + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 4`. The formula `n - left - 1` gives us `8 - 3 - 1 = 4`.

#### Strategy 2: Keep Only the Suffix  
```
Original: [1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]
          ←--remove this part--→ ←-suffix-→
          [1, 2, 3, 10, 4]      [2, 3, 5]

Result: [2, 3, 5] ✓ (already sorted)
```

When we keep only the suffix, we preserve elements from index `right` to the end (indices 5, 6, 7) and remove everything from index 0 to `right - 1` (indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). The number of elements to remove is simply `right = 5`.

Our current best answer is `min(4, 5) = 4`. These represent our baseline solutions - the simple approaches that we know will definitely work, even if they might not be optimal.

#### Why These Are Our "Baseline" Options

These calculations establish our worst-case answer. We're essentially saying: "Even if we can't be clever about combining parts, we know we can solve the problem by removing at most 4 elements." This baseline is crucial because Step 4 will try to do better by being more sophisticated, but we need to know what "better" means.

### Step 4: Try Merging Prefix and Suffix

```python
# Use two pointers to find the best prefix-suffix combination
i = 0
j = right
while i <= left and j < n:
    if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
        ans = min(ans, j - i - 1)
        i += 1
    else:
        j += 1
```
Now, why do we use AND instead of OR?
If we used while i <= left or j < n, the loop would continue even when one side becomes invalid. For example, if i goes beyond our good left part but we still have elements in the array, we'd keep trying to make combinations. But those combinations would use elements from the chaotic middle section, which defeats the whole purpose.
We specifically need elements from both the good left part and the good right part to create a valid sorted sequence. If either side becomes unavailable, we can't form valid combinations anymore.
Think of it like making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You need both peanut butter AND jelly. If you run out of either ingredient, you can't make the sandwich, even if you still have the other ingredient.



This is the most sophisticated part of the algorithm. We're exploring whether we can do better by keeping both a prefix and a suffix. However, there's a crucial constraint: the last element of whatever prefix we keep must be less than or equal to the first element of whatever suffix we keep. Otherwise, the combined sequence won't be sorted.

```
Prefix candidates: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,10]
Suffix:           [2, 3, 5] (starting at index 5)
```

Let's trace through each iteration of the two-pointer approach:

#### Iteration 1: i=0, j=5
```
Array: [1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]
Index:  0  1  2   3  4  5  6  7
        ↑              ↑
        i=0            j=5
```

We're checking if `arr[0] ≤ arr[5]`, which is `1 ≤ 2`. This is true, so we can merge the prefix `[1]` with the suffix `[2, 3, 5]`.

The resulting array would be `[1, 2, 3, 5]`, and we need to remove the elements between index 0 and index 5 (exclusive). These are the elements at indices 1, 2, 3, 4, which gives us the elements `[2, 3, 10, 4]`. That's 4 elements to remove.

The formula `j - i - 1 = 5 - 0 - 1 = 4` calculates exactly this. Our answer becomes `min(4, 4) = 4`.

Since we found a valid merge, we advance the prefix pointer to try a longer prefix: `i = 1`.

#### Understanding the j - i - 1 Formula

The formula `j - i - 1` counts the elements we need to remove from the "middle" when we combine a prefix and suffix. Let me break this down carefully:

When we have `i=0` and `j=5`:
- We keep: prefix from index 0 to i (inclusive) plus suffix from index j to end (inclusive)
- We remove: everything between index i and index j (exclusive)
- The indices to remove are: i+1, i+2, ..., j-1
- The count of integers from (i+1) to (j-1) inclusive is (j-1) - (i+1) + 1 = j - i - 1

Think of it like houses on a street: if you keep house 1 and houses 6 onward, you remove houses 2, 3, 4, 5. That's 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 houses, even though the distance from house 1 to house 6 is 5.

#### Iteration 2: i=1, j=5
```
Array: [1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]
Index:  0  1  2   3  4  5  6  7
           ↑           ↑
           i=1         j=5
```

We're checking if `arr[1] ≤ arr[5]`, which is `2 ≤ 2`. This is true, so we can merge the prefix `[1, 2]` with the suffix `[2, 3, 5]`.

The resulting array would be `[1, 2, 2, 3, 5]`, and we remove elements at indices 2, 3, 4. That's 3 elements: `[3, 10, 4]`.

The formula gives us `j - i - 1 = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3`. Our answer becomes `min(4, 3) = 3`.

We advance the prefix pointer: `i = 2`.

#### Iteration 3: i=2, j=5
```
Array: [1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]
Index:  0  1  2   3  4  5  6  7
              ↑        ↑
              i=2      j=5
```

We're checking if `arr[2] ≤ arr[5]`, which is `3 ≤ 2`. This is false! We cannot merge the prefix `[1, 2, 3]` with a suffix starting at `[2, 3, 5]` because 3 > 2, which would violate the sorted order.

Since the condition fails, we advance the suffix pointer to find a larger starting element: `j = 6`.

#### Iteration 4: i=2, j=6
```
Array: [1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]
Index:  0  1  2   3  4  5  6  7
              ↑           ↑
              i=2         j=6
```

We're checking if `arr[2] ≤ arr[6]`, which is `3 ≤ 3`. This is true, so we can merge the prefix `[1, 2, 3]` with the suffix `[3, 5]`.

The resulting array would be `[1, 2, 3, 3, 5]`, and we remove elements at indices 3, 4, 5. That's 3 elements: `[10, 4, 2]`.

The formula gives us `j - i - 1 = 6 - 2 - 1 = 3`. Our answer remains `min(3, 3) = 3`.

We advance the prefix pointer: `i = 3`.

#### Iteration 5: i=3, j=6
```
Array: [1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]
Index:  0  1  2   3  4  5  6  7
                 ↑        ↑
                 i=3      j=6
```

We're checking if `arr[3] ≤ arr[6]`, which is `10 ≤ 3`. This is false, so we advance the suffix pointer: `j = 7`.

#### Iteration 6: i=3, j=7
```
Array: [1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]
Index:  0  1  2   3  4  5  6  7
                 ↑           ↑
                 i=3         j=7
```

We're checking if `arr[3] ≤ arr[7]`, which is `10 ≤ 5`. This is still false, so we would advance the suffix pointer, but `j` would go out of bounds, so we exit the loop.

**Final Answer: 3**

The optimal solution is to remove 3 elements. Specifically, we can remove `[10, 4, 2]` to get `[1, 2, 3, 3, 5]`, which is properly sorted.

## Why This Algorithm Works Efficiently

The algorithm leverages a key insight about the structure of the final sorted array. In any valid solution, the remaining elements must form a non-decreasing sequence. This sequence can only be created by combining a sorted prefix and/or a sorted suffix from the original array.

The two-pointer approach in Step 4 efficiently explores all valid prefix-suffix combinations. The beauty of this approach is that it only advances the prefix pointer when we find a valid merge, and advances the suffix pointer when the current prefix element is too large. This ensures we check all potentially optimal combinations in linear time.

The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity because each element is visited at most a constant number of times across all steps. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables to track our pointers and current best answer.

## Additional Examples to Reinforce Understanding

### Example 2: Already Sorted Array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

**Step 1:** The entire array is non-decreasing, so `left = 4` (last index).
**Early termination:** Since `left == n - 1`, the array is already sorted, so we return 0.

### Example 3: Reverse Sorted Array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

**Step 1:** Only the first element forms a valid prefix, so `left = 0`.
**Step 2:** Only the last element forms a valid suffix, so `right = 4`.
**Step 3:** Keep prefix costs 4 removals, keep suffix costs 4 removals.
**Step 4:** Cannot merge because 5 > 1.
**Result:** 4 elements must be removed.

### Example 4: Mixed Case [1, 3, 2, 4]

**Step 1:** Prefix `[1, 3]` ends at `left = 1` because 3 > 2.
**Step 2:** Suffix `[2, 4]` starts at `right = 2`.
**Step 3:** Keep prefix costs 2 removals, keep suffix costs 2 removals.
**Step 4:** Can we merge `[1]` with `[2, 4]`? Yes, 1 ≤ 2. Cost: 1 removal.
**Result:** Remove just the element 3 to get `[1, 2, 4]`.

This comprehensive analysis shows how the algorithm systematically explores all possible ways to create a sorted sequence while maintaining optimal efficiency. The key insight is recognizing that any valid solution must preserve the inherent order within existing sorted subsequences of the original array.
